title: "Diary — Дневник Deutschland"
---

Raisa's personal diary, written in two notebooks. The first — a 10-kopeck Ukrainian school notebook brought from Kyiv — bears the handwritten title **«Дневник Deutschland»** (Diary Germany). The second is a German shorthand notebook (Deutsches Kurzschrift-Heft) marked №2.

Unlike her censored letters home, the diary contains direct political language, emotional depth, and literary prose. She wrote it with awareness of a future reader: *"Полагаю читающий мой прекрасно поймёт остальное"* (I assume my reader will perfectly understand the rest).

She wrote to the very last page — even around the multiplication table printed on the back cover.
