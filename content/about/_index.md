## Raisa Grygorievna Pogorelova (Раїса Григорівна Погорелова)

Born around 1924 in Kyiv, Ukraine. Taken to Germany as an Ostarbeiter (forced laborer) in April 1942 at age 18.

She worked on a farm in Schönaich, a village in Franconia, Bavaria — 46 km south of Würzburg. Her host was a farmer named Walter, whose family included sons Ludwig, Eduard (~24, a soldier), and "Schön" (~21), and daughter Hedwig.

From September 1943, she was transferred to factory work in Hannover (Podbielskistraße 100).

She kept a diary in two notebooks — a Ukrainian school notebook ("Зошит", 10 kopecks, 12 pages) she brought from Kyiv, and a German shorthand notebook she acquired in Germany. On the cover of the first she wrote: **Дневник Deutschland**.

## The Letters

Raisa wrote home constantly — to her sister **Anna** (born ~1920), her grandmother, and the children Grishunok and Motik. Mail between Germany and occupied Ukraine traveled via **Deutsche Dienstpost Ukraine**. Only postcards were allowed; letters were returned stamped "Zurück." All outgoing mail bore Nazi censor marks.

Despite being a forced laborer earning 17 marks/month (later ~70 marks/month), Raisa sent parcels home: silk stockings, soap, saccharin, pencils, seeds, sausage, and cash.

## Preservation

These 180 pages — letters, postcards, envelopes, and diary notebooks — survived the war, Soviet times, and a family emigration from Kyiv to Germany. In February 2026, **Maksym Prokopov** (Raisa's grandson) digitized the entire archive and had the handwritten Russian text transcribed with the assistance of AI.
