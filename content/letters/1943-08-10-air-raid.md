## Context

On August 10, 1943, Raisa witnessed (or heard about) a massive Allied bombing raid visible from Schönaich — approximately 100 km away. More than 500 bombers, 13 shot down. This likely refers to the bombing of **Schweinfurt** or **Nuremberg**, both within range.

For Raisa and the other forced laborers, these raids carried a double meaning — terror from the bombs, but also hope that the war was coming to an end. The masters who had seemed so powerful were now the ones being bombed.
