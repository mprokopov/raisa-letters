## Context

After the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, the mood shifted dramatically. Raisa noticed the German "masters" suddenly becoming nervous and attentive to their workers. Wounded soldiers were returning from the Eastern Front without arms and legs.

For the first time, Raisa writes with open defiance: *"Soon we'll show them!"* She even calls Germany *"проклята"* (cursed) — remarkable for censored correspondence. The power dynamic was shifting, and everyone could feel it.
