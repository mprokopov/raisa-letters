## Transcription

> ...выйдите на тротуар то смотрите, справа от входа на 3ч — этаже. У нас всё в порядке настроение ещё и самочувствие искреннее нормальное. Целуем вас всех. Мать и Сын.

## Context

This brief fragment stands apart from all other correspondence in several crucial ways:

**Physical Characteristics:**
- **Brown kraft paper** instead of wartime German letter paper
- **Pencil** instead of blue ink
- **Torn condition** suggesting rough handling or poor storage

**Content Differences:**
- **No elaborate greeting** — brief, matter-of-fact tone
- **Giving directions** to a building: "3rd floor, right of entrance"
- **"Mother and Son"** signature — completely different from Raisa's usual signatures

**Historical Context:**
This appears to be from the **post-war period** (1945-1946+) based on:
- **Different materials** available after war
- **Practical content** — helping someone find their new address
- **Changed circumstances** — no longer writing elaborate letters

**Possible Scenarios:**
1. **Post-repatriation:** Raisa and family member writing to relatives about their new Soviet housing
2. **Displaced persons period:** Writing from DP camp or temporary housing
3. **Resettlement:** Directions to new apartment assignment after return

**Personal Significance:**
The phrase **"настроение ещё и самочувствие искреннее нормальное"** (mood and health are genuinely normal) suggests they felt the need to reassure recipients about their psychological and physical condition — understandable after years of forced labor.

**Family Structure:**
The **"Mother and Son"** signature raises questions about family composition post-war. This could be:
- Raisa and a younger brother (Grisha/Motik?)
- Raisa's mother and Raisa
- Different family members entirely

This fragment provides a glimpse into the **post-war period** that's rarely documented in the archive — the practical, brief communications of survivors rebuilding their lives.
